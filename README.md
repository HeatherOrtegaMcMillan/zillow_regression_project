- Repo with work 
    - Final Notebook (link here)

## Questions and Goals
- To predict the values of **single unit properties** that the tax disctrict assesses using the property data from those with a transaction during the "hot months" of May-August, 2017.
- What are the drivers of these single unit property values

- What states and counties these properties are located in
- What is the distribution rate of the tax rates for each county

- The first iteration of my model, I will use only square feet of the home, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms

### Inital Ideas and Hypotheses
